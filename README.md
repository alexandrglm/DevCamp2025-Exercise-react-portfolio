# Manual Fixes Needed for 2025:

#### 1. Do not update packages
Avoid running `npm i <package>`. This environment is intended to stay on these legacy versions.

#### 2. `npm run start` may fail on many Linux setups with Python 2.x
Because of modern system security hardening, you need to adjust Chokidar watchers:
- Add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`

```json
"scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npm set audit false",
    "start": "CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true webpack-dev-server --config webpack/dev.config.js --watch",
```

#### 3. `axios` updated to 1.12.0 (no breaking changes)

#### 4. Update `html-webpack-plugin` to 4.5.2, which updates `loader-utils` to 1.4.2

#### Notice: Prototype Pollution in `js-extend`, used as example: 

**Package:** `js-extend`  
**Version:** 1.0.1 (transitive dependency via `babel-plugin-async-to-promises@1.0.5`)  
**Vulnerability:** Prototype Pollution

`js-extend` versions â‰¤ 1.0.1 allow attackers to manipulate the prototype of base objects, potentially causing denial of service or remote code execution.  

**Impact:**  
- Only relevant if compiling untrusted or external code.  
- **If your project only compiles trusted code, the risk is minimal**.  

**Project will be migrated to newer react-babel-etc when finished, including breaking changes**
